            <h2><em>Blue Bells of Scotland</em></h2>
            <p>
                This month’s Tune of the Month features the first in a set tunes many of you are familiar with. No awa’ (a.k.a. Johnnie Scobbie) and Bonnie Charlie were both street sets some time ago.  The third, Blue Bells, is a traditional march that a number of us played with the massed band the past few Tartan Day parades.

                Playing Notes
            </h3>
            <p>
                The tune is a straightforward 4/4 march with an AABA structure.  Pay special attention to the third full measure on the second line written.  This phrase features 4 quarter notes in a descending skip, and must be played cleanly.
