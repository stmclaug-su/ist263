    I’m a part-time IMT major with 6 courses to go after this semester.  I have been a member of the Syracuse (NY) Fire Department for 20+ years, where my current position is district chief.  The job gets a bit more technical every day, and I’m happy to say I’ve been able to leverage what I’ve learned at the iSchool to assist in some major projects.  Outside of work and school, I enjoy spending time with my family, camping, and playing the bagpipes.
